# hello-world

Hi GitHub! 

 My name is Yordan, and I'm new to programming. I was not interested at first, but I said "Why not trying it?". I would try to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and others, so I can have more knowledge and not stuck with what I'm currently studying at university (Most universities in my country are not on the same road as the other in the world).
